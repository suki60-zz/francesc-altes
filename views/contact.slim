      | road to developer
    .text-lowercase.pb-3
      | Curiosity has been always part of my life. Also, a passion for technology. Because of that, I started a Mechanical Engineering Degree, where I created my firsts programmes with C++. During my stage in Finland, I was fortunate to take part of a Demola R&D project. There, I learnt what means to work in a team on a real case, where success will depend on your expertise, talent and ideas. After ending my degree, my curiosity for coding was still in mind and thatâ€™s how I found Ubiqum, where they enlightened me and I became a developer.
